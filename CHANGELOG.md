## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fab1ae2: Full accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and responsiveness hardening pass across every component.

  Accessibility:

  - `Tabs` reworked to the complete WAI-ARIA Tabs pattern: roving `tabIndex`, Arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation with disabled-trigger skipping and wrapping, `id`↔`aria-controls`/`aria-labelledby` wiring between each trigger and panel, focusable panels, and an `orientation` prop.
  - `Input` / `Textarea`: `hint` text is now linked to the control via `aria-describedby` so screen readers announce it.
  - `Alert`: new `assertive` prop switching the live region to `role="alert"`; defaults to `true` when `variant="danger"`.
  - `Avatar`: keeps its accessible name (via `role="img"` + `aria-label`) when the image fails and it falls back to initials; `AvatarGroup`'s "+N" bubble is now labelled ("N more").
  - `Checkbox` / `RadioGroup` controls enlarged to a 24×24px minimum touch target (WCAG 2.5.8); `Dialog` and `Toast` close buttons padded to a real hit area.
  - `Breadcrumb` current-page marker simplified to a plain `aria-current="page"` span (no more `role="link"` + `aria-disabled`).
  - `Table` column headers now carry `scope="col"`.

  Responsiveness — every component is usable at 320/768/1280px with no forced horizontal page scroll:

  - `Dialog` content capped to `w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` with internal scroll for tall content; `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, and `Toast` viewports capped to the viewport width with a gutter.
  - `Table` renders inside a horizontal scroll container instead of overflowing the page.
  - `Tabs` list scrolls when it overflows; `Pagination` wraps.

- a9e461a: Ship a CommonJS build alongside ESM. `require("@marcfs31/design-system")` now resolves to `dist/index.cjs` with its own `dist/index.d.cts` types; ESM consumers are unchanged (`dist/index.js`). `publint` and `@arethetypeswrong/cli` both pass clean across `node10`, `node16` (CJS and ESM), and bundler resolution. Non-breaking — nothing was removed or renamed.

### Patch Changes

- a9e461a: Fix `--fors-fg-muted` (dark theme) failing WCAG AA contrast on `ink-surface` and `ink-surface-2` — it only cleared 4.5:1 against the base `ink-bg`. Nudged `#75818d` → `#8a95a1` (now ≥ 5.2:1 on every ink surface). Caught by the new full-browser axe pass on the Table header, which renders `text-fg-muted` on `ink-surface-2`. The token-contrast test now checks `fg-muted` and `fg-secondary` against all three ink surfaces so this can't regress. `ToastDescription` also switched from `opacity-90` (which tipped `text-danger` under AA in the danger toast) to solid `text-fg-secondary`.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- First stable release of the Fors design system.

  - Dark (default) and light theming via `[data-theme]`, with WCAG AA contrast enforced by an automated test against the real token values — no `ThemeProvider` required; consumers get `applyForsTheme`/`forsAntiFlashScript` instead.
  - 30 components: typography (`Heading`, `Text`), forms (`Button` with a built-in `loading` state, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Switch`, `Select`, `Slider`), overlays (`Dialog`, `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `Toast`/`Toaster`/`useToast`), feedback and data (`Alert`, `Badge`, `Avatar`/`AvatarGroup`, `Spinner`, `Progress`, `Skeleton`, `Card`, `Table`, `Tabs`, `Accordion`), and navigation (`Breadcrumb`, `Pagination`).
  - Overlay and select components are built on Radix UI primitives for correct focus/keyboard/ARIA behavior, restyled entirely through this package's own Tailwind token vocabulary.
  - Real open/close motion on every overlay via `tailwindcss-animate`, driven by Radix's own `data-state`/`data-side` attributes, and automatically neutralized under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - Every component ships a Storybook story (with autodocs generating a props table from its TypeScript types) and a co-located test covering behavior and accessibility (`vitest-axe`).
  - Production build via `tsup` (ESM, typed) plus a separately compiled `styles.css` (no Preflight reset, safe alongside a consumer's own Tailwind base).
  - CI (typecheck, lint, test, build, build-storybook) and a Changesets-driven release process publishing to GitHub Packages.
